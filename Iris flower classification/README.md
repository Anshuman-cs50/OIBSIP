# Project Title

IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION

## 📝 Project Overview

The project is about creating a classifisation model which can distinguish between the different species of iris. This problem is classical machine learning project and forms a quick hands on experience of training a machine learning classification model on labeled dataset.
